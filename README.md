## Install
```bash
$ npm install --save vue-breakpoint-component
```

## Usage
To use the component in your templates, simply import and register with your component:

### Script
```js
import { VBreakpoint } from 'vue-breakpoint-component'

export default {
  components: {
    VBreakpoint
  }
}
```

### Template
```html
<v-breakpoint>
  <div slot-scope="scope">
    <span v-if="scope.isSmall"  style="font-size: 2rem">   üò∏  </span>
    <span v-if="scope.isMedium" style="font-size: 4rem">   üò∏  </span>
    <span v-if="scope.isLarge"  style="font-size: 6rem">   üò∏  </span>
    <span v-if="scope.isXlarge" style="font-size: 8rem">   üò∏  </span>
    <span v-if="scope.noMatch"  style="font-size: 10rem">  üò∏  </span>
  </div>
</v-breakpoint>
```

## Global Install
You can also choose to install the component globally. This will install three components `v-breakpoint`, `v-show-at`, `v-hide-at`.

```js
import Vue from 'vue'

import { Install as VBreakpoint } from 'vue-breakpoint-component'

Vue.use(VBreakpoint)
```

## Show-At/Hide-At Usage
To use the component in your templates, simply import and register with your component.

### Script
```js
import { VShowAt } from 'vue-breakpoint-component'

export default {
  components: { VShowAt }
}
```

### Template
```html
<v-show-at small>     üò∏  </v-show-at>
<v-show-at medium>    üò∫  </v-show-at>
<v-show-at large>     üòΩ  </v-show-at>
<v-show-at xlarge>    üê±  </v-show-at>
<v-show-at no-match>  üòø  </v-show-at> <!-- Aka Bootstrap 4 "xs" -->
```

## Multiple Root Elements (Experimental)
Notice that you can also show/hide multiple elements using an experimental Fragment-like component hack, described [here](#experimental-features).

### üöß Note
To unlock this feature, you will have to [configure](#configuration) the component with the `experimental` flag.

### Template
```html
<v-show-at small>
  <span>üò∏</span>
</v-show-at>
```

## V-Model
You can also take leverage of the breakpoint state without composing inside it, using a `v-model`.

### Script
```js
import { VBreakpoint, Model } from 'vue-breakpoint-component'

export default {
  components: {
    VBreakpoint
  },
  data: () => ({
    model: new Model()
  }),
  computed: {
    style() {
      if (this.model.isSmall) {
        return {
          width: '1rem',
          height: '1rem'
        }
      }
      if (this.model.isMedium) {
        return {
          width: '2rem',
          height: '2rem'
        }
      }
      if (this.model.isLarge) {
        return {
          width: '3rem',
          height: '3rem'
        }
      }
      if (this.model.isXlarge) {
        return {
          width: '3rem',
          height: '3rem'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Template
```html
<v-breakpoint v-model="model"></v-breakpoint>
<div :style="style"></div>
```

## API Props
```js
debounceTime: {
  type: Number,
  default: 50,
  description: 'Time to wait before invoking resize handler.'
}
```

## API Events
The component emits two core events, `input` and `change`. The `input` event is required for `v-model` usage, but other than that, it's fairly similar to `change` event. Each of these events benefit different composition styles.

### Payloads
#### Input and Change Events `(state[Object])`
Each of these events has the same payload. Besides breakpoint state, they also supply some auxiliary state, like **viewport** and current **inner window dimensions** (which are also aliased for convenience). Example:

```js
{
  breakpoint: "small"
  isSmall: true
  isMedium: false
  isLarge: false
  noMatch: false
  iw: 623
  ih: 1077
  innerWidth: 623
  innerHeight: 1077
  vw: 1920
  vh: 1200
  viewportHeight: 1200
  viewportWidth: 1920
}
```

### Breakpoint Event `(state[String])`
This event has a fairly simple payload. Example:

```js
'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'xlarge' // Etc'
```

### Breakpoint-Namespace Event
Besides those events, the component also emits a breakpoint-namespace event per breakpoint defined. Thus, you can do something like:

```html
<v-breakpoint @small="handleSmall"></v-breakpoint>
<v-breakpoint @medium="handleMedium"></v-breakpoint>
<v-breakpoint @large="handleLarge"></v-breakpoint>
<v-breakpoint @xlarge="handleXlarge"></v-breakpoint>
<v-breakpoint @no-match="handleNoMatch"></v-breakpoint> <!-- Aka Bootstrap 4 "xs" -->
```

## Configuration
The default breakpoints are based on [Bootstrap 4 (Stable)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints). To customize the component you will have to use the descriptor Constructor. Start off by creating a new component asset, e.g.: `VBreakpoint.js`. Then, use the following snippet and adjust configuration to your needs.

```js
// <project-root>/src/components/VBreakpoint.js

import Vue from 'vue'

import { Ctor } from 'vue-breakpoint-component'

const config = {
  debounceTime: 50,
  experimental: false,
  breakpoints: {
    small: '(min-width: 576px)',
    medium: '(min-width: 768px)',
    large: '(min-width: 992px)',
    xlarge: '(min-width: 1200px)'
    ...
  }
}

const components = { ...new Ctor(Vue, config) }

export const VShowAt = components.VShowAt
export const VHideAt = components.VHideAt
export const VBreakpoint = components.VBreakpoint

export default VBreakpoint
```

### Usage
Import **locally** and use as you would normally.

```js
// Local imports
import { VShowAt, VHideAt, VBreakpoint, Model } from './VBreakpoint'

export default {
  components: {
    VShowAt,
    VHideAt,
    VBreakpoint
  },
  data: () => ({
    model: new Model()
  })
}
```

### Default Breakpoints (Bootstrap 4)
```js
// Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
// No media query for "xs" since this is the default in Bootstrap

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
// @media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
// @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
// @media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
// @media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
```

### Custom Breakpoints
You can define an **infinite** amount of breakpoints. For media-query syntax see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries).

## Experimental Features
#### Wrapping Multiple Root Elements (Fragment Hack)
As you may know, Vue does not support a stateful `Fragment` component, which allows you to render a component with multiple root elements, overruling the "single root element" principle dictated at the outset of component-based architecture. It was introduced to React during a full re-write. You can learn about it from [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html). Vue is likely to follow suit in a similar manner (probably with Vue 3). This feature request is currently discussed [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7088). Meanwhile, I decided to hack a Fragment component, which is also incorporated into this component, thanks to Github user [y-nk](https://github.com/y-nk). I elaborated his [solution](https://github.com/y-nk/vue-fragments) so it can also show/hide content (using directives like `v-show` or `v-if` won't work here).

#### üöß Note
Since this is a hack, it is likely not to be extended into a fully supported feature. Feel free to contribute back though.

## Browser Support
This component relies on [matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) API (IE 10+). For older browsers and IE, you will need a polyfill. There's [@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/) and [@weblinc](https://github.com/weblinc/media-match). Weblinc's seems more maintained.
